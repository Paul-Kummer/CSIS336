# Concept Test 2

### Question Format ###
The test consists of 9 coding questions:  
- 6 dealing with LINQ
- 2 with inheritance 
- 1 with exceptions.

The questions are in the following classes:
- `LINQQuestions.cs`
- `InheritanceQuestions.cs`
- `ExceptionHandlingQuestions.cs`

### Instructions ###
To complete the test:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open ConceptTest2.sln
3. Open each file mentioned above to find the test questions.
3. Each question has 2 parts: 
    - A question in comments prefaced by `// Question #`
    - A following TODO comment prefaced by `// TODO:`
4. Replace each `// TODO:` comment with code to complete the questions.
5. Remove the `// TODO:` comment when done.
6. To see all remaining `// TODO:` lines, you can use the Task List in Visual Studio (View->Task List).
7. When complete, commit your code and push your changes to github.
8. Double check your repo in github to make sure your changes are there.

Note: The LINQQuestions use an object model defined in Orders.cs.  To see a UML diagram for the object model, see OrderClassDiagram.cd.
