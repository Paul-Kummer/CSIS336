# Computer Programming Symbolize Life - Poem by Tyree Mitchell
Computer programming can be a hassle
It's like trying to take a defended castle
When the program runs you shout with glee
But when you get errors you cry with plea

There are programming languages like C Plus Plus
But then there are others that cause a fuss
At the end of the day you may have something done
But by the next day you restart all the fun
