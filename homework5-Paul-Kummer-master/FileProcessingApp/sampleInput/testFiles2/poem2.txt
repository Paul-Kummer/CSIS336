# Programming Is Art - Poem by Tea Kawana
As if he were a painter, 
he interpreted his thoughts using colour, with his tools: 
several brushes and a paint palette.
As if he played in some orchestra or band, 
and the notes from the sheet music were
expressed through the very contact of his
instrument and himself; and the translation
of the incomprehensible beautiful marks on the sheet, 
to a set theme, one could envision in the mind, was impeccably evident through play.
As if he were a dancer, 
having polished up all the various essential techniques…
and how the flexibility and movement of his body
extract the notation to beautiful action.
Through his own specialty, 
I see all these come into play, 
I see art.
